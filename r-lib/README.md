# R Package Development Skills

Skills for R package developers working with the r-lib ecosystem and modern R package development workflows.

## Available Skills

### `testing-r-packages`

Best practices for writing R package tests using testthat version 3+. Use when writing or modifying tests for R packages, organizing test files and fixtures, creating snapshot tests, mocking external dependencies, or following BDD patterns with describe/it.

**Organization**: Uses progressive disclosure with reference files. Core workflows load automatically from SKILL.md, while specialized topics (BDD, snapshots, mocking, fixtures, advanced topics) load only when needed from the `references/` directory.

**Resources**: This skill synthesizes guidance from:
- [R Packages: Testing Basics](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-basics.html)
- [R Packages: Testing Design](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-design.html)
- [R Packages: Testing Advanced](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-advanced.html)
