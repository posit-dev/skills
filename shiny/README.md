# Shiny Skills

Skills for Shiny app development in both R and Python.

## Overview

This category contains skills that help with building, styling, and deploying Shiny applications. Skills support both Shiny for R (using bslib) and Shiny for Python frameworks.

## Available Skills

### `brand-yml`

Create and use `_brand.yml` files for consistent branding across Shiny applications (R and Python) and Quarto documents. Use when working with brand styling, corporate identity, colors, fonts, or logos.

**Organization**: Main skill file includes workflows and decision tree. Reference files provide framework-specific integration guides:
- `brand-yml-spec.md` - Complete brand.yml specification
- `shiny-r.md` - Shiny for R integration with bslib
- `shiny-python.md` - Shiny for Python integration with ui.Theme
- `quarto.md` - Quarto integration for all formats

**Note**: This skill is also registered in the quarto category since brand.yml works across both Shiny and Quarto projects.
